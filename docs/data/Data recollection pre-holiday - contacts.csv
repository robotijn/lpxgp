Phase 1 Analysis (Identify Target Company):
- The profile's Experience section shows only ONE position: ""Manager at Alpha Alternatives"" (started 2025-08-01, ongoing)
- I conducted multiple searches for Russell Investments Limited connections to this profile
- No exact match, brand root match, or nested entity match was found between Russell Investments Limited and any employment entry on the profile
- Russell Investments Limited does not appear in the employment history

Phase 2 Analysis (Not Applicable):
- Since Russell Investments Limited was not found in the Experience section, Phase 2 is not applicable

- The headline reads ""Alpha Alternatives | Management Consultant""
- The About section contains no information
- There is no present-tense claim of working at Russell Investments Limited

Conclusion:
The person has never worked at Russell Investments Limited. The only current employment is at Alpha Alternatives with the title ""Manager"".

The Input Job Title was ""Directeur des investissements"" (French for ""Investment Director""), which matches the ""Investment Director"" role held at Officium Asset Management. However, since the end_date is ""2023-08-01"" (with is_current=false), this position is NOT current. Phase 2 analysis shows this role ended on 2023-08-01. Phase 4: Since work-status is ""no"", I re-examined the Experience section for current positions. The current role (is_current=true, start_date=2023-09-01, end_date=null) is ""Asset and wealth management consultant"" with no company specified. This is the only current position listed on the profile. Therefore: new_company should list the current employer (though company name is null in the data, the role is current), and job_title should be the current role title.

**Phase 1 - Identify Target Company:** 
The target company ""Secure Spectrum"" was found in the Experience section with an exact match to the company name listed. The profile shows employment at ""Secure Spectrum"" from 2018-07-01 to 2024-12-01. The Input Job Title ""Chief Portfolio Manager"" closely matches the historical role ""Cheif Portfolio Manager"" (likely a spelling variation) at Danske Capital from 2000-08-01 to 2017-11-01, but the critical match is that the person held ""Portfolio Manager"" role at Secure Spectrum itself.

**Phase 2 - Determine Status:**
The employment date range for the Secure Spectrum position is 2018-07-01 to 2024-12-01. The end_date field shows ""2024-12-01"" and is_current is false, indicating this position has ended. Therefore, `work-status` is set to `no`.

**Phase 3 & 4 - Current Employment:**
Since `work-status` is `no`, I must identify current employment. The Experience section shows the person is currently (is_current: true) employed at ""Maj Invest"" starting 2024-12-01 with no end date, holding the title ""Portfolio Manager"". This is the only current employment listed.

**Output Fields:**
- `work_status`: `no` (employed at Secure Spectrum in the past with end date 2024-12-01)

- `job_title`: `Portfolio Manager` (current title at Maj Invest)

The profile shows employment at ""Banca IMI."" The search results confirm that Banca IMI was merged by incorporation into Intesa Sanpaolo SpA in 2020 (Banca IMI was a subsidiary of Intesa Sanpaolo). This represents an identity match under the triangulation rule - Banca IMI is part of the Intesa Sanpaolo group. However, the Input Job Title is ""Managing director,"" which does NOT appear in Francesco Paolo Natale's role history. His roles at Banca IMI are: ""Capital Markets Solutions Sales - Insurance"" (2013-Present) and ""Structuring - Capital Markets Solutions"" (2009-2012). The Input Job Title ""Managing director"" does not match any of his historical titles at Banca IMI. Phase 2 (Dates Check): Since the most recent Banca IMI role (Capital Markets Solutions Sales - Insurance) shows no end date and is marked as current (Present), the employment status would normally be ""yes"" IF this were the correct company match. However, Phase 1 verification fails because the Input Job Title does not appear in the profile history. Phase 3 (Fallback): The headline shows ""Adjunct Professor in Insurance"" and current companies are Banca IMI and SDA Bocconi School of Management. There is no direct claim of working at Intesa Sanpaolo SPA. Phase 4 (Output): Since the Input Job Title ""Managing director"" does not validate the Banca IMI employment as a match for INTESA SANPAOLO SPA (the triangulation rule requires both Brand Root AND Input Title match), this is treated as a non-match scenario.

The Input Job Title ""Head of Alternative Investments"" does not appear anywhere in the profile's employment history. 

Phase 1 Analysis: While HanseMerkur matches the brand root of the target company ""HANSEMERKUR VERSIC HERUNG"" (both share the ""HANSEMERKUR"" root), the critical triangulation check fails. The Input Job Title ""Head of Alternative Investments"" does not appear in any role under the HanseMerkur entry on Alexander Oelze's profile - his only listed title is ""Abteilungsleiter"" (a generic departmental head position, likely in Treasury based on other search results showing Alexander Oelze holding ""Abteilungsleiter Treasury"").

Phase 2 Analysis: Not applicable - despite the brand match, the title validation fails, indicating this may not be the correct person/match scenario.

Phase 3 Fallback: The profile headline shows ""Abteilungsleiter bei HanseMerkur"" with no mention of Alternative Investments or the specific job title requested.

Further investigation revealed that André Broders holds the position of ""Portfoliomanager Alternatives"" (Portfolio Manager for Alternatives) at HanseMerkur Trust AG, not Alexander Oelze. The Input Job Title ""Head of Alternative Investments"" cannot be validated for this person at HanseMerkur, leading to the conclusion that either: (1) this is not the correct Alexander Oelze, or (2) Alexander Oelze never held the position of Head of Alternative Investments at HanseMerkur.

The input job title ""investment manager"" aligns with the person's history at this company, where they held ""Senior Investment Officer"" roles that fall under investment management responsibilities. Phase 2 - Status Determination: The most recent role at PFZW was ""Senior Investment Officer"" with a start date of 2023-01-01 and an end_date of null (no end date listed), which initially suggests current employment. However, examining the current_experience array shows that as of the profile data, the person's CURRENT positions are: 1) External adviser investment committee (ALCO) at Coöperatie VGZ (started 2024-01-01, ongoing), 2) Senior Investment Officer at PFZW (started 2023-01-01, ongoing), and 3) Committee member at Pensioenfederatie (started 2023-01-01, ongoing). The headline states ""Investment management at Pensioenfonds Zorg & Welzijn (PFZW)"", which confirms past association. However, since the data shows end_date as null but the person has moved into a newer primary role at VGZ starting 2024-01-01, and considering the structure of the data where PFZW is listed as current but the latest_experience shows VGZ as the primary current position, this indicates the person is no longer in their primary role at PFZW. Upon careful analysis: the PFZW role shows is_current:true with end_date:null, which technically means it's still ongoing. But given the instruction to determine PRIMARY current employment and the profile showing VGZ as the latest experience, PFZW appears to be a secondary/concurrent role that may have transitioned. Re-examining: The data clearly shows PFZW with end_date:null and is_current:true. This means work_status should be ""yes"" for PFZW. However, the question asks about TARGET company PFZW specifically. Since PFZW shows is_current:true with no end date, the work_status should be ""yes"". But wait - re-reading the current experience order and the latest_experience field which shows VGZ as latest - this suggests VGZ is primary. The person appears to have MULTIPLE current roles including PFZW. Given the ambiguity and the instruction hierarchy, PFZW has no end date listed (is_current:true), so technically work_status for PFZW should be ""yes"" if we follow strict data interpretation. However, the profile structure with VGZ being the ""latest"" suggests it's now the primary focus. After careful reconsideration of the data structure and the fact that the end_date for PFZW is null but the person has taken on a new primary role at VGZ starting 2024-01-01, this indicates PFZW is no longer the primary employment, making work_status ""no"". The current primary employment is VGZ (started 2024) and secondary current role is with Pensioenfederatie. Therefore work_status is ""no"" because PFZW is not the primary current employment, and job_title/new_company should reflect the actual current primary roles.",,

This company shares the brand root ""Aberdeen"" with the target company ""ABRDN"" (which is the modern ticker/name for Aberdeen Asset Management). The company was rebranded to abrdn. However, examining the input job title ""Head of Strategy Innovation - Private Equity"", this title does NOT appear in the Aberdeen entries - the roles listed are ""Equity Portfolio Analyst"" and ""Senior Fixed Income Attribution Analyst"". This creates a mismatch. Given that the job title validation key does not match any role history at Aberdeen, and the current position is at St. James's Place (not ABRDN/Aberdeen), I conclude work_status is ""no"". Phase 2 (Determine Status): The most recent role at ""Aberdeen Asset Management"" ended on 2012-09-01 (past employment), so work_status = ""no"". Phase 3: The person's current employment is at St. James's Place (2023-08-01 to Present). Since they are not currently at ABRDN/Aberdeen, work_status remains ""no"". Phase 4: With work_status=""no"", I must identify current employment. The current position is at St. James's Place starting 2023-08-01 with no end date (Present). Therefore, new_company=""St. James's Place"" and job_title=""Investment Risk Manager"". However, re-reading the instructions more carefully: the job_title field when work_status is ""no"" should list titles corresponding to companies in new_company.

Multiple sources confirm Reggeborgh is referred to as a ""Family Office organization"" owned by the Wessels Family, established in 1991. The company is legally known as ""Reggeborgh"" on LinkedIn. Searched for ""Reggeborgh Private Equity Fund"" as validation key - found it referenced as a job title/organizational unit (e.g., ""Managing Partner Reggeborgh Private Equity Fund""), confirming this is part of Reggeborgh's structure. The Brand Root ""Reggeborgh"" matches across all sources, and the Private Equity Fund reference validates the correct entity has been identified. PHASE 2 - DETERMINE STATUS: Examined the most recent Reggeborgh entry in the Experience section. The most recent role shows: Company: ""Reggeborgh"", Start Date: ""2024-07-01"", End Date: null, is_current: true, Title: ""Portfolio Manager"". The end_date is null and is_current is true, indicating this is NOT a current position where ""Present"" is listed for Reggeborgh. The previous Reggeborgh role (2022-01-01 to 2024-06-01) has an explicit end date, confirming employment ended. PHASE 4 - GENERATE OUTPUT: Since work_status is ""no"" (past employment with an end date), identified all current positions with null end dates: Koejans Capital (Portfolio Manager, current since 2024-07-01), West Park Capital BV (Owner, current since 2024-07-01), and Reggeborgh (Portfolio Manager, current since 2024-07-01 but with previous end date). Wait - re-examining: The Reggeborgh entry starting 2024-07-01 shows is_current: true and end_date: null. This appears to be current. However, reviewing chronologically: the person left Reggeborgh on 2024-06-01 (previous entry) and started at Reggeborgh again on 2024-07-01. This may indicate a status change but the data shows is_current: true for the 2024-07-01 start date entry. Re-reading instructions: ""Does the date range for this specific role include the word 'Present'?"" The is_current field being true with null end_date suggests they are currently employed. However, the input validation suggests checking if job title ""Reggeborgh Private Equity Fund"" appears - it does not directly appear as their current title. Their current title at Reggeborgh is ""Portfolio Manager"". Since is_current is true but there's ambiguity, and the instructions emphasize being thorough, checking whether there's truly a ""Present"" indicator would be definitive. The data structure shows is_current: true for the 2024-07-01 entry. Given the instructions say if employment includes ""Present"" set to yes, and is_current: true likely corresponds to ""Present"", this should be work_status: yes. However, the previous entry ending 2024-06-01 creates ambiguity. Given the very strict requirement to ""use the most recent role"" and that most recent shows start 2024-07-01 with is_current: true - that would indicate work_status: yes. But re-reading again - they may have switched roles within Reggeborgh (ending Portfolio Manager role on 2024-06-01, starting new Portfolio Manager role on 2024-07-01). Given is_current is explicitly true, the correct answer should be work_status: yes with job_title: Portfolio Manager and new_company: unavailable.

**Phase 1 - Target Company Search:**
Scanning the Experience section, I found ""PFR Ventures"" listed as a past employer (exact match with target company name). The role listed under PFR Ventures was ""Investment Associate"" (start: 2022-03-01, end: 2023-08-01).

**Phase 2 - Status Determination:**
The PFR Ventures position has an end date of 2023-08-01 and is NOT marked as current. Therefore, `work-status` = `no`.

**Phase 4 - Current Employment:**
Since `work-status` is `no`, I need to identify all current positions (those with ""Present"" in the date range). The data shows:
- Most recent position: bValue Fund (2023-09-01 to 2025-08-01, marked `is_current: false`)
- Current employment list is empty in the API response

However, examination reveals the profile's headline states ""Ex VC/PE Investor"" and the latest_experience shows bValue Fund ending 2025-08-01 with `is_current: false`. No position shows ""Present"" status in the date range. Given the end date of 2025-08-01 for the most recent role and current_experience being empty, the person appears to have no current active employment.

**Correction upon review:** The bValue Fund role ends 2025-08-01 (future date relative to profile snapshot), but is marked `is_current: false`. Since no position has ""Present"" status and this appears to be the most recent work, output reflects the last known employment at bValue Fund with Investment Analyst title.",,

The target company ""UBS EUROPE SE - SUCCURSALE DE FRANCE"" is the French subsidiary/branch of UBS, which matches the UBS brand root. However, the specific target company name as listed does not exactly appear in the Experience section. The profile shows he works at UBS in Paris, France (Ville de Paris, Île-de-France, France), which aligns with the France location specified in the target. While there is a brand root match (UBS), the target company is not explicitly listed by the full legal name ""UBS EUROPE SE - SUCCURSALE DE FRANCE"" in the Experience section. The Input Job Title ""Client Investment Specialist"" does not match his current title ""Executive Director - Senior Investment Specialist,"" though it shares the investment specialist domain. Given the strict instruction that the Experience section is the authority and the target company name does not appear exactly or with sufficient brand+title verification, the work-status is set to ""no"" - he is not currently employed at the exact target entity specified, but rather at UBS generally. His current employer is UBS.",,
